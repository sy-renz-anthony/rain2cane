# Rain2Cane

Project Rain2Cane: An IoT-based Smart Rainwater Collection and Irrigation Monitoring Platform for efficient and sustainable Sugar Cane Farming with android and web apps integration.

*Due to lack of resource and time constraints, we need to revert back on using MERN framework. the native app: either it will be written in React Native or Android java, it depends on how much time we have left to study React Native but if time doesn't permit it, needed to switch to java Android. Maybe I would include a QR code as well for the web app's ease of access.
