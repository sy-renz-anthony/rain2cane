# Rain2Grain
Project Rain2Grain: An IoT-based Smart Rainwater Collection and Irrigation Monitoring Platform for efficient and sustainable Rice Farming with android and web apps integration.

*This is our capstone project, initially planned on using java's Springboot framework as the backend server but still need to study it, plus since it cannot be easily deployed on render.com, need to study docker and containerization as well. the front end will be written in React still and haven't decided yet what to use for the required native app: either it will be written in React Native or Android java, it depends on how much time we have left to study React Native but if time doesn't permit it, needed to switch to java Android. Maybe I would include a QR code as well for the web app's ease of access.
